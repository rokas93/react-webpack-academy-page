Any free moment you will find me hiking, camping or sleeping in a tent by the lake, be it hot summer evening or drizzly early spring or autumn day. Business developer turned software developer, lover of dogs and basing life decisions by a golden rule: when in doubt, go for a walk."

Despite my tendency to spend excessive time in front of my computer and get insufficient sleep, I am always eager to take on a good challenge."
